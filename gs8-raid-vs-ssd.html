RAID 0 offers striping with no parity or mirroring. Striping means data is "split" evenly across two or more disks. For example, in a two-disk RAID 0 set up, the first, third, fifth (and so on) blocks of data would be written to the first hard disk and the second, fourth, sixth (and so on) blocks would be written to the second 
Сравнение скоростных характеристик ssd и hdd  Теперь пришло время рассказать про параллельное выполнение операций. In a recent webinar I discussed how a Hybrid System could be architected so that it could perform as well, or almost as well, as an All-Flash Array. If the IT planner decides to implement a Hybrid Array, there is another decision to be made and it’s often a question we get asked, “Which. Бенчмарки.

Dell M.2 FAQ regarding AHCI vs RAID ON, Storage Drivers, M.2 Lanes, Performance Что указывают в характеристиках ssd. Технические характеристики nand, публикуемые на официальных сайтах производителей и в сетевых магазинах, далеко не всегда содержат подробную информацию. Lustin, I agree with most of what you have said, particularly in regards to SSD being so much better at random IO than an HDD, making them a far better choice in comparison. Hello everyone, I'm sorry if this has been asked before, but I did a search and didn't find anything. I'm looking for a middle-high range gaming laptop (00-1500ish). When specing out various laptops, I've been opting for the hybrid drives (usually with a 4gb SSD) because I assumed that would give me the best speed for the lowest price. However, I've seen on some sites that for about  dollars more I could go ahead and just get a secondary 40 gb SSD. What is this subreddit's experience.

Yes, absolutely if your new/destination RAID controller model is the same as the old one, the array should come up fine. But with all the vendors and even models being integrated into motherboards, it’s not always. Оперативная память. Стандарт памяти ddr4, объем — чем больше. тем лучше. 8Гб — абсолютный минимум, 16Гб — оптимально для начала, дальше — по вкусу и кошельку. RAID (Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks or Drives, or Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is a data storage virtualization technology that combines multiple physical disk drive components into one or more logical units for the purposes of data redundancy, performance improvement This storage will be used for a Hyper-V replica server which will store copies of VMs in case our prod servers go down. My own conclusion is to go with less drives for less chance of failure but it's more of a guess :)SSD is already plenty fast so I would not go with more drives for the 16x spead gain if that is even possible with 6Gbps. Also, our prod VM's sit on a 3 node starwind cluster with SATA RAID 5 6Gbps. For this reason I thought of matching what we have and sticking with RAID5. 
Предисловие Рисунок 1-1. Дирай Пандей, CEO, Nutanix. Для меня большая честь писать предисловие к этой книге, которую мы зовем Библия Nutanix. Not all solid-state storage is as fast as an SSD. “eMMC” is the kind of flash storage you’ll find in cheap tablets and laptops. It’s slower and cheaper than a traditional SSD you’d find in more expensive computers.

QUESTION What is the best way to setup storage so that a couple hundred gigs on my workstation are reserved for data work and not over run with games and media? My question is regarding the 2TB NVMe SSD. I am getting this as an upgrade to a 1TB 850EVO. I want to reserve a couple hundred gigs for a SQL database. The server will be for long term data storage on the and automated collection on the RAID, the NVMe in the workstation will be for active use data. This ended

Getting a laptop with a Solid State Drive inside will increase responsive and real-world performance more than any other component. Hi I'm looking forward to my first proxmox build and first try with zfs. I'm wondering what the best practices are for system redundancy with SSDs? I'm concerned about installing on two identical 500GB SDDs in RAID-1, since it seems likely they might fail around the same time. To avoid this, would it be possible to basically install onto both drives (essentially just getting a bootable boot loader on both and keeping track of the bios boot order) and then just have a nightly rsync I just want a discussion about RAID vs SSD/HDD combo and if possible to merge the drives (similar to how apple's fusion drive works) I just want to know more about it and the pros and cons of using raid against ssd/hdd. Would you guys recommend running two of the 860 evo 500GB in Raid (would total 0CAD) Or just one 1tb 860 evo (0CAD) I feel like the performance increase with the raid setup would be worth the . Just don’t feel like it’s common for people to do this. Hi, amp#x200B; plan to upgrade to 2x Nvme SSD's in RAID 0 as my Boot Drive.

I have POF setup of an enterprise server (IBM x3550m4) running with just an Intel PCIe-card-form-factor p3600 1.6Tb, hosting an ERP with MS SQL DB and a fileserver with ~400Gb of regular office files. Have done several benchmarks in the last months and everything is running just fine. I will soon put this stuff in production, and I have a spare (new, with 1.2 Tb of 10k spindles) x3550m4. within my budget (~1500 euro, less is better), I’m thinking about two architectural pattern to get better. I have a K-12 customer that is interested in an on site ~20TB (usable) NAS solution for their video editing lab. We are their MSP/ISP, so I offered to carve out some storage in our EMC appliance, but they denied. They just want something they can host in that classroom and just plug into an access-layer switch (I believe they are running Cisco 2960X) to be mapped to a drive. Important things (as defined by the customer): - 00 budget - Needs to have AD integration for access control - Backup. Which way would I was wondering if I should get hardware raid or just stick with SSDs? On a supermicro xeon d configuration with their chassis so I can only fit 4x 3.5" hdds and 2x 2.5" ssds. ESXI doesnt support software raid and at the moment I have 2x5 TB hgst drives and would need another 2 more from somewhere as well as getting a raid controller to properly setup raid. I have 2x5 TB hgst drives for data in fakeraid mode in xpenology. It's probably not running correctly. I'm setting up a (CentOS 7.4) box which needs a volume for cache files, I have 4 Samsung SSDs (960GB SM863s) installed in the machine for this purpose. I'm wondering what would be a better idea, using Linux md-raid RAID0 (simple, passes through TRIM requests to the underlying drives) or a ZFS pool with 4 single-SSD vdevs (benefits of RAM ARC, possibly compression). Any thoughts on what's better here? I can definitely set up and test both ways, but some pointers or thoughts would be useful. I know that optane offers very little improvement over an ssd, but I got it as a gift and I feel like I need to use it. if I go with raid, I will probably use it in a relative's build or maybe a future htpc build. Long time gamer, first time builder. I am looking to build a decent gaming PC in the 0-,000 range and would like some help with my build.

Hey all - I have much experience with enterprise grade SANs/arrays and flash, but there's a lot of "behind the curtains" that doesn't get revealed to the end user. Obviously they all use enterprise class SSDs with power failure protection (capacitors). I have a 24 bay Supermicro w/ SAS2 backplane I am looking to move 8 4TB drives into (preserving that VD/data) but also adding some SSDs for a dedicated SSD VD/pool. I'd like redundancy but I don't need the I/O or fail-safe of RAID10 ABOUT -- I was asking myself "What kind of RAID should I configure?" a lot lately. ampnbsp; Assumptions I gathered through time: - HW RAID is faster than SW, - HW RAID is more expensive, - in case HW RAID card dies, you can't assemble the array without a replacement card. ampnbsp; So with those assumptions in place, you would only use hardware raid where needed (because they aren't cheap), and should always have a backup card in storage. In my free time I tested a couple of cards. I've heard conflicting opinions on this from posts inside this subreddit, anandtech, windows forums etc. what really is the difference between these two? I just got a 960 evo nvme drive for my dell 9550 and am wondering whether I should switch to AHCI since I will be doing a clean install. and what is the recommended option considering what dell supports and the kind of set up I'm going to be running. We have an older storage server running 24 x 1TB SATA drives in Raid 10 configuration, offering 12Tb of storage capacity. We are thinking of replacing it with 14 x 1.2Tb Intel SSD drives but in Raid 6 offering the same total capacity. Would this be a good idea or should we stick with Raid 10 ? I'm guessing even in Raid 6, the performance would be higher than with the SATA drives, correct. What's the difference between RAID 0 and RAID 1?
