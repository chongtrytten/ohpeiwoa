Hello all, I'm an engineering student that has been lurking in this sub for a month or so, I find it interesting to read discussions between professionals in the machinist field. Me and a friend are currently working on a custom build RC car (1/5 scale) and we need to make a few prototype pinion gears for the drive-train. We already have a spur gear that will be used for now with what I think is an involute geometry. Willing to learn I would like to try and create my own drawings As per the title, "mental gymnastics" here refers the practice of making extraordinary leaps in logic, wild assumptions, and supporting generally poor apologetics in the defense of religious mythology. Keep in mind, this mostly applies to those who take some degree of literal interpretation about their religion, but other more metaphorical interpretations can also qualify as mental gymnastics. For example, stretching the Creation mythology in the Bible (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_c. 
TLDR : Passed with 828. Used Dion's Udemy course and Sybex practice test book, about 5 weeks total study time. I'm a web developer doing DoD contract work, and had Sec+ and CEH alrady. Details below - I hope they help! # Study Resources My primary source of study was Jason Dion's Udemy Course (https://www.udemy.com/comptiacsaplus/) and review of my own notes on the course for about a month. For an additional week I went through about half of CompTIA CySA+ Practice Tests Sybex Book (https. Rather than type this out piecewise every couple days, I figured I would make a general reference post. This will cover back to the 90's and let you evaluate the quality of a used bike's groupset compared to what's currently for sale. Source is my brain, but you can find the same information at si.shimano.com (https://si.shimano.com) It's searchable from a web browser for the current generation, and in PDFs going back decades. In general, Shimano has named groupsets in descending quality:. The conversation with Lott (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_YA2cxgd5Y) got very technical, and the follow up will be even more so. It might be good and fun to summarize the disagreement and review some relevant texts, if only for myself. Most of the in-text links are supplementary, leading to Wikipedia, source texts and a selection of graphs from papers. general tl;dr : Don't expect that science is ready to confidently resolve all the gun policy questions, against or pro guns. Someone posted this on Blind, a pretty interesting read, especially if you want to learn what bad architecture looks like https://www.teamblind.com/article/Technical-incompetence-at-Wayfair----is-there-anything-worse-43wn8iLT (https://www.teamblind.com/article/Technical-incompetence-at-Wayfair----is-there-anything-worse-43wn8iLT) Full text: gtIs there anything worse than Wayfair at this scale in terms of sheer technical incompetence and poor engineering practices??? gt gtI've worke. I know this is not that much of a feat but it's still a milestone in my eyes. so I wanted to sincerely thank everybody who participates in this community and helped me and others along the way, at times I can really get paralyzed by information overload and this place helped quite a bit with that. Special thanks to /u/Kai_973, your words of encouragement and advice really meant a lot. I just noticed it's basically been 6 months since I started learning Japanese, I wanted to share Are there any websites, forums, or groups out there that offers one on one training or services for people who aspire to be hackers? For the past couple of months I’ve been trying to teach myself the basics of hacking. I’ve purchased a few Udemy courses that was recommended as well as watched YouTube videos. Although there are some good free materials out there I feel like it’s doesn’t go in depth enough about the types of commands and attacks, as well as when to use them. Also, I find myself.

And, on a special side note.Every April Fool's. In 1962, Dr. Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider formulated the earliest ideas of global networking in a series of memos discussing an “Intergalactic Computer Network.” Both well-liked and well-respected, he demonstrated an amazing prescience many times over. His original and far-sighted ideas outlined many of the features the Internet offers today: graphical computing, user-friendly interfaces, digital libraries, e-commerce, online banking, and cloud computing. In 1963, while he was serving The CollectiveGO The CollectiveGO is an augmented reality practice powered by platform's fundamental token and monetized by numerous digital currency promoters.

I’ve used Evernote for years and I found that I’m not using it as much recently. I also discovered Notion and the way you can incorporate multiple things/columns into a single note, so I gave it a shot this week. All these tools work well and do some things better, but man oh man, Evernote is the king of the hill in my estimation. So powerful. Attachments that can be edited inline (Word, Excel etc), clipper, OCR, markup of PDFs and easy screen shots — the list goes on. I’ll be using Notion. </p>
