I am teaching myself Mandarin. Mostly via the Pimsleur method with some supplemental flashcard apps. What I feel would be really useful right now is hearing more native conversation. The trouble is I can't read Chinese at all and the internet/itunes/Amazon/ampc. are so effective at figuring out your 'correct' location that searches result in only 'educational' podcasts for English speakers wanting to learn Mandarin. But I just want to listen to people speak the language. I have found a couple. podcast website for people to learn and teach English. I've been learning Thai for about a month now. I'd like to get some sort of podcast that I can listen to. I'd like something that talks about a bunch of different topics, but anything topic will do.

Hey /r/lithuania, I am looking for Lithuanian podcasts. Something suitable for someone with very basic Lithuanian skills. Preferably something like VOA News' Special English podcast, which is regular news read slowly. Perhaps there are "learning Lithuanian" podcasts? But really, any radio/news programs or amateur podcasts will do, as long as they keep the language basic or slow.

My class (of Japanese doctors) has asked for longer podcasts they can use during commuting and cleaning and such. They want all topics, but including science/medical news is a real plus. Previously, I had given them the Nature podcast, but the English is a bit tough and the topics are all science. Much obliged!
